A dashboard with Jira integration.
It's perfect for development teams who want to be aware of their progress in real time.

## Widgets

- **Bugs History** – bugs amount chart.
- **Week Number** – the current week number.
- **Bugs Difference** – contains two numbers: the current amount of bugs and the amount of bugs one week ago.
- and many more are coming.
